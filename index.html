         <p>
          Having a hope, gives the soul the sustaince to keep moving. I have never coded prior to UCSD Triology's Bootcamp Pre-Work assignment. Furthermore, I was not good with computers. But, it is the hope within me that is driving my desire to learn coding.</p>

        <p>
          I learn to forgive myself when I become frustrated in learning something new to me like coding. I believe my hope + my accepting my struggle as a learning progress will drive me to success.

              <div class="card-body">
                <p>I was born in Somalia in the fall of 1988. I don't remember much of Somalia. My parents fled Somalia after the start of Somalia's devestating civil war in 1991. My parents had seven children. I was the third to last. In the midst of the civil war, my mother lost the two youngest children of the family. I became the youngest of the remaining five children. Little did I knew the magnitude of the loss my parents were suffering. As a child myself, all I cared about was playing with other children. After several more years of living in Ethiopia, a neighboring country, my family were among the lucky few that were given refugee status by the United States government. We were flown out of Ethiopia and to San Diego, California in 1996. I grew up in San Diego and have not left ever since.</p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <p>I don't have many hobbies, but what I enjoy doing is hiking. Although I have not done it yet, I love stargazing. It is definitely on my to-do-list. I also enjoy spending time watching good movies and television series. Ever since I took interest in coding, I began to develop a passion for it. Despite the many hours it takes coding and the amount of frustration one experiences, in the end of the day, it is one of the most fun things to do. For some, it is just a job, for other, it becomes a hobby.</p>
